# cuti

A collection of C utilities. Currently only developed on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04.4 LTS), but planned to be extended for Windows and maybe MacOS at some point.

This library is developed in parallel to a game engine I'm working on, Anonymous Game Engine (https://github.com/kcmw3e/AGE), and is the primary purpose for it.
